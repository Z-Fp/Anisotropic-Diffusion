# Anisotropic-Diffusion
 The Anisotropic Diffusion (AD) technique has originally been suggested
for noise mitigation in image processing without omitting
the explanatory image parts such as edges and lines, which
are notable for image analysis. In AD, the aim is to
have an approximation of the edges.
